# Custom Axe-Con schedule

This page / site was created to share the [Axe-Con](https://axe-con.com) schedule and add functionality to make it work for **us**.

If you want to test out the site locally, [ThreeJS has a nice set of docs on how to run a local server](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/How-to-run-things-locally).
