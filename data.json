This is partly due to SVGs having a small footprint for such high visual fidelity, in a world where bandwidth and performance matter more than ever, especially on mobile devices and situations/locations where data is at a premium. But also because SVGs are so flexible with their integrated styles, interactivity, and animation options. What we can do with SVGs today goes way beyond the basic shapes of yesteryear."

From day one, the remediation and certification process was a case study in building accessibility from solid moral grounds and shaky organizational ones. Our team is proud of our work, but we did quite a bit wrong to get it right. In this talk, we’ll share what we’ve learned from our mistakes so that you can avoid the same ones on your own accessibility journey."
